* 2.11BSD httpd

A small, and fairly bad, web server which runs under 2.11BSD.

- Only supports GET.
- Will send images, add your own MIME types if you like.
- Assumes web root is ~/var/www~
- Probably insecure.
- Contributions very welcome.

If my PDP-11 is running, you can see the page it hosts at
http://catbert.rhwyd.co.uk

** Setup Instructions

Copy httpd.c to your PDP-11, compile it and move the binary to the
proper place:

#+BEGIN_SRC
cc httpd.c -o httpd
mv httpd /usr/libexec/httpd
#+END_SRC

Append the following line to ~/etc/inetd.conf~

#+BEGIN_SRC
http    stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/libexec/tcpd       httpd
#+END_SRC

Find the process ID of inetd and send it a HUP:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ps aux | grep inetd
kill -HUP <PID>
#+END_SRC
